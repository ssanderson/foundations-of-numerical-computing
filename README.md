# Foundations of Numerical Computing

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/master)

This repository contains lecture slides, exercises, and deployment scripts for
**Foundations of Numerical Computing**, a tutorial given by Scott Sanderson at
PyCon 2018.

You try the lecture and exercise notebooks on [binder](https://mybinder.org/)
by clicking the button above.

The materials in this repository are organized as follows:

- [Lecture.ipynb](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/0-Lecture.ipynb)
  contains the notebook used by the presenter during the lecture sections of
  the tutorial.

- [Finding Functions and
  Documentation.ipynb](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/1-Finding%20Functions%20and%20Documentation%20in%20Jupyter.ipynb)
  is a notebook used as a warmup exercise to get students comfortable with
  Jupyter. It shows you how to use `np.lookfor` to search Numpy by keyword, and
  it shows you how to read function documentation using Jupyter's `?` operator.

- [Creating and Reshaping
  Arrays](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/2-Creating%20and%20Reshaping%20Arrays.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to create and reshape arrays in a variety of ways.

- [Universal Functions](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/3-Universal%20Functions.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to use Numpy's universal functions.

- [Selections](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/4-Selections.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to use the ndarray `[]` to select
  data out of numpy arrays.

- [Reductions](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/5-Reductions.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to apply reduction functions like
  `min`, `max`, and `min` across axes of arrays.

- [Broadcasting](https://github.com/ssanderson/foundations-of-numerical-computing/blob/master/ansible/files/materials/6-Broadcasting.ipynb)
  contains exercises that teach students how to use broadcasting in conjunction
  with.

Each notebook also has a (Solutions) notebook next to it that contains worked solutions for each of the exercises.
